# sotbot
A sea of thieves discord bot that lets you store information in a database and then query it back to explore at your own pace.
## installation:
### prerequisites:
* latest python3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* latest discord.py (```pip install discord.py```)
### how to use
* create a bot on discord https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/
* make a bot for the application you create (on the left click on "bot" and then click on "add bot")
* save that bot's token as an environment variable on your system called "discord_sot_token" (you might need to restart after this!!)
* invite the bot to your server
* download contents of this git
* run ```python bot.py```
* (optional) if you want to change the prefix, edit the PREFIX variable in bot.py 
    ie. change it from ```PREFIX = "sot"``` to ```PREFIX = "[whatever prefix you want here]"```
* profit!
